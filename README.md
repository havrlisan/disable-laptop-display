# Display disabler
A simple Windows application that blackens out the display it is currently on. Useful for laptops whose display cannot be turned off.

The app completely lowers the brightness of the display it is on and overlays a black color. It automatically opens on a secondary screen. When closed, the previous brightness will be set.

Press `WindowsKey + LeftArrow` or `WindowsKey + RightArrow` to move the app to another screen.

Press `Esc` to close the app.
