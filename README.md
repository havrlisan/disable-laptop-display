# Display disabler
A simple Windows application that dims the laptop display as much as possible. Useful only if:
1) you have a second monitor that you use as a primary display, and
2) your laptop display cannot be turned off without turning off other screens as well.

The app completely lowers the brightness of the display it is on and overlays a black color. It automatically opens on a secondary screen. When closed, the previous brightness will be set.

Press `Esc` to close the app.
